OpenRP
======

What is OpenRP?
---------------
OpenRP is an RP mod that is being designed for JKA. As the name states, it shall be used for Role-playing, but in addition to this, we intend for the mod to be relatively easy to use, all the while incorporating many features of other mods, in addition to some of our own. This will make for the best role-playing experience, all the while not having a clunky or difficult to use interface.

OpenRP's goals
--------------
 * We intend to have menus that perform the commands for you instead of always having to type it out. However, should you want to continue using the console, you are completely free to do so!
 * We further wish for the mod to have useful features, all the while incorporating feedback from its own user-base, to make this modification for JKA Role-play the very best it can be!

What features does it have?
---------------------------
We are using an account and character creation system (courtesy of Legacy OJP), in addition to an administrative system. We are also working on security fixes, bug fixes, and limit increases. The former two are self-explanatory, but what limits mean is that we wish to increase the maximum vehicles allowed, in addition to the maximum characters in your name. Not only are we working on these two, but we also wish to expand the Force power levels to level 5 as opposed to the base 3.

What is planned for OpenRP in the future?
-----------------------------------------
We wish to add a credits system in addition to an experience feature. We wish to design the menus to look and interact better with the user.

What operating systems will OpenRP be available on?
---------------------------------------------------
OpenRP will be available on Windows. Linux may be supported after some issues with Linux compatibility are worked out. No Mac support is planned as no developers have access to a Mac.

Can I download a .zip of OpenRP now?
------------------------------------
Sorry, but currently a .zip of the mod cannot be downloaded. The developers have decided not to release any testing versions until it is very close to the release date. You can however, compile the source code if you want to, but a .zip version will not be released until it is closer to the release date.

Can I develop or help with OpenRP?
----------------------------------
Of course! We always enjoy the prospect of having more volunteers to aid us in the building of this mod.

At this time, we require:
 * Several coders to aid us.
 * One who is experienced with menu construction.
